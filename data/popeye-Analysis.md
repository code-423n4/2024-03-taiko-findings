# Overview of Taiko

Taiko is an Ethereum-equivalent ZK-Rollup that aims to provide scalability without sacrificing security or compatibility. It leverages advancements in Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) cryptography and applies them to prove the correctness of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution on the rollup. Taiko's primary goal is to support all existing Ethereum applications, tooling, and infrastructure, making it a "Type-1" ZK-Rollup.

### Key Features and Functionalities:

**Ethereum-Equivalence**: Taiko prioritizes full Ethereum-equivalence, allowing the rollup to support all existing Ethereum smart contracts, dapps, developer tooling, and infrastructure. This compatibility extends to network participants, builders, and end-users, ensuring a seamless experience.

**ZK-EVM**: Taiko utilizes a ZK-EVM component that proves the correctness of EVM computation on the rollup. It aims to minimize the impact on proving performance while maintaining complete compatibility with Ethereum.

**Lightweight and Decentralized Architecture**: The Taiko protocol consists of Taiko nodes, provers, and smart contracts. Taiko nodes construct rollup blocks from user's L2 transactions and commit them to L1. Provers generate ZK-SNARK proofs asserting the validity of L2 transactions and blocks. Smart contracts deployed on Ethereum L1 act as the data availability mechanism and verifier of the ZKPs.

**Tokenomics**: The Taiko token (TKO) plays a crucial role in enhancing the decentralized and permissionless nature of Taiko's rollup solutions. It acts as a fundamental component for governance and operational efficacy, underpinning critical bond systems in both the Based Contestable Rollup (BCR) and Based Booster Rollup (BBR) designs.

**Multi-Hop Bridging**: Taiko includes a built-in cross-layer communication mechanism to facilitate communication across multiple Taiko L2s and L3s. This multi-hop bridging allows for seamless interaction between different layers of the Taiko ecosystem.

**Efficient Block Verification**: Taiko employs an efficient block verification process that allows parallel proving of blocks. Provers submit proofs for blocks, and once a proof is submitted for a block and its parent block, the block is considered on-chain finalized.

**Customizable Tiers**: Taiko supports different tiers for provers, allowing for flexibility in the proving process. Each tier has its own configuration, including the verifier contract, validity bond, contest bond, and other parameters. The protocol selects the minimum required tier for each block based on a random input.

**Modularity**: The architecture is designed in a modular way, with separate contracts and libraries handling specific functionalities, allowing for easier upgradability and maintenance.


### Creative Insights of the Architecture


**TaikoL1 and TaikoL2 Interaction**: The `TaikoL1` and `TaikoL2` contracts work in tandem to enable the secure and efficient processing of transactions on the Taiko L2 chain. The `TaikoL1` contract serves as the anchor point on Ethereum L1, verifying and finalizing blocks proposed on L2. Meanwhile, the `TaikoL2` contract handles the execution of transactions and maintains the state of the L2 chain. This interaction between L1 and L2 contracts allows for a balance between scalability and security.

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Taiko utilizes ZK-SNARKs to generate succinct proofs of the validity of transactions executed on the L2 chain. These proofs can be efficiently verified on Ethereum L1, ensuring the integrity of the L2 state transitions without requiring L1 to replay all L2 transactions. This use of ZK-SNARKs enables significant scalability improvements while maintaining the security guarantees of Ethereum.

**Optimistic Rollup Fallback**: In addition to the ZK-Rollup mode, Taiko also supports an optimistic rollup fallback mechanism. This allows the protocol to continue processing transactions even in the absence of ZK-SNARK proofs, relying on a challenge-response game to ensure the validity of state transitions. The flexibility to switch between ZK-Rollup and optimistic rollup modes enhances the resilience and adaptability of the Taiko protocol.

**Bridge and SignalService**: The Bridge and SignalService components play a crucial role in enabling cross-chain communication and asset transfer between Ethereum L1 and Taiko L2. The Bridge contract handles the locking and unlocking of assets on respective chains, while the SignalService utilizes Merkle proofs to securely relay messages and state information between chains. This architecture allows for seamless interoperability and opens up possibilities for cross-chain dApps and liquidity.

**Vaults and Token Management**: The Vaults contracts (`ERC20Vault`, `ERC721Vault`, `ERC1155Vault`) provide a secure and efficient mechanism for managing the bridging and storage of different token standards across chains. These contracts ensure that tokens are properly locked on the source chain and minted on the destination chain, maintaining the integrity of token balances. The TaikoToken, being the native token of the Taiko ecosystem, serves as a unifying element for governance, staking, and fee payments.
