## Admin Abuse Risks

**Description**: The `SgxVerifier` contract includes functions for managing trusted SGX instances, adding and deleting them from a registry. These operations are restricted to the contract owner or a named role ("`rollup_watchdog`"). However, if the owner or a privileged role misuses their authority or if the contract owner's account is compromised, they could abuse their power to add or delete SGX instances arbitrarily. This could result in unauthorized access or manipulation of the SGX verification process, compromising the security and integrity of the system.

**Potential Impact**: The potential impact of admin abuse could be severe, leading to unauthorized SGX instances being added to the registry, which may not have undergone proper attestation or validation. Additionally, the deletion of legitimate SGX instances could disrupt the verification process, leading to the acceptance of invalid proofs or the rejection of valid ones. This could undermine the trustworthiness of the system and result in financial losses or other adverse consequences.
